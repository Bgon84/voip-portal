# voip-portal

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is only to showcase some of my work. This is not a full application, but rather a selection of files from an application I helped write for a previous employer. This is therefore a very simplified example of my capabilities.

## Overview
The application from which these files came was a customer portal for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) customers. The application allowed customers to configure their phone systems and user access, as well as manage their voicemail, fax, and sms messages. Within this repository you'll find two main sections, PBX Admin and PBX User. As the names indicated, the PBX Admin section is restricted to admin users and allows that user to configure phone system components such as Call Parking, Phonebooks, and Music on Hold albums and tracks. A PBX User user can only access sections that an Admin or higher level user has assigned to them. These sections include phone features such as Faxing and Phonebook management. 

### Tech
The application was built in Laravel 9 with PHP 8.2. No Javascript frameworks were used, but jQuery was utilized for page interactivity. The Laravel Livewire package was also utilized to provide real-time data updates where applicable. Other javascript plugins were also used as needed across the application. MariaDB was utilized for data management.
